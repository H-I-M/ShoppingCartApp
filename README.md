# ShoppingCartApp
This is a simple java implementation of a shopping cart and the processes around adding items to the cart and checking out. 


## Challenge 

1. Write a Shopping Cart class that will accept a product that is added to the class.
2. Adding more than 1 type of product should result in different line items in the cart
3. Adding the same product type should increase the quantity of the item in the class
4. The total price of products in the cart should be reflected when retrieving the cart via a view method on the cart.
5. Add a 10% special discount that is applied to certain product types when purchasing more an 1 quantity.

## Design 

1. I did not over complicate the code, tried to keep it intuitive and to the point.
2. Followed a very simple MVC-like pattern by sepparating the view/console, logic and validation classes. 
3. Input validation.

## Known issues / needs of improvements

1. Improve robustness of input validation 
2. UI
3. Catalog management

## Running/ Deploying the app

1. have the latest version of Java installed 
2. Ensure 'JAVA_HOME' is set up in enviroment variables
3. Download/pull the project into your IDE.
4. Clean and build project (just encase)
5. Run the project (this is a terminal interface application).
